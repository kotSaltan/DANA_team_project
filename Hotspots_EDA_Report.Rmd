#### Set project path and load dataset

```{r}
# Get the name of working directory in RProject
proj.path <- getwd()
hotspots_raw <- read_csv(file.path(proj.path,'hotspots.csv'))
```

#### Convert date format

```{r}
# Check the date format
hotspots_raw$rep_date <- as.POSIXct(hotspots_raw$rep_date, format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
str(hotspots_raw$rep_date)

# Add year and month columns
hotspots_raw$year <- year(hotspots_raw$rep_date)
hotspots_raw$month <- month(hotspots_raw$rep_date, label = TRUE, abbr = TRUE)  # Months as factor (and named)

```

#### Subset data from period 2014 - 2023 (10 years)

```{r}
# Subset the dataframe to include only data from 2014 to the end of 2023
hotspots <- hotspots_raw %>%
  filter(year >= 2014 & year <= 2023)

# Check range of date
range(hotspots$rep_date) # 10 years period for further observations
```

#### **To identify specific fire events, apply DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise) function and classify every data point into cluster. The number of clusters has to be close to the official information from BC Website (<https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/safety/wildfire-status/about-bcws/wildfire-statistics/wildfire-averages>)**

```{r}
# Prepare the data for clustering based on latitude, longitude, date
event_data <- hotspots %>%
  select(lat, lon, rep_date)

# Convert date to numeric for clustering
event_data$date_numeric <- as.numeric(as.POSIXct(event_data$rep_date))

# View event_data
head(event_data)
```

#### Scale the converted date in numeric to have similar range as latitude / longitude. 1 degree of coordinate is \~ 111 km and 20 hours \~ 72000 seconds.  Add new column named event_cluster to the hotspots dataset

```{r}
# Scale factor : 1 second ~ 0.001 degrees (approximately)
event_data$date_scaled <- event_data$date_numeric * 0.001

# Apply DBSCAN clustering
db <- dbscan(event_data[, c("lat", "lon", "date_scaled")], eps = 0.6, minPts = 5)
# eps value of 0.6 degrees is about 66 km

# Add cluster labels to the original dataset
hotspots$event_cluster <- db$cluster
```

#### Preview single specific event for observation

```{r}
# Filter for a specific cluster (event of fire) for sample
event_500 <- hotspots %>%
  filter(event_cluster == 500)# Replace with the specific cluster number

event_500
# OUTPUT 14 observations lat 53 lon -124 on 16 July 2014
```

#### Count the events without noise included

```{r}
# Count the number of unique clusters
num_clusters <- length(unique(hotspots$event_cluster))-1 # Subtract 1 to exclude the noise cluster (label 0)
num_clusters

# Total number of fires in BC (official table)
2293+1801+1647+670+825+2117+1353+1050+1858+1481+1861
# 16956
```

#### Summary of the clusters

```{r}

# Detailed summary of the clusters
event_details <- hotspots %>%
  filter(event_cluster != 0) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarise(
    first_cluster = first(event_cluster),
    start_date_hotspot = min(rep_date),
    end_date_hotspot = max(rep_date),
    events_count = length(unique(event_cluster))
  )
print(event_details)

# First_cluster column : Number of cluster started from 1 and increase based on the following fire cluster and grouped by year.
# Start_date_hotspot : Start date of fire event captured by hotspot
# End_date_hotspot : End date of fire event captured by hotspot
# Events_count : Total number of fire event in yearly basis based on cluster.
```

#### Analyse the fire events in graphs.

```{r}
# In order to identify the time period to focus on and further yearly basis comparison purpose, summarize the number of cluster per year and month (exclude number of noise)

# Summarize the number of fire events per year and month
fire_events_per_month <- hotspots %>%
  filter(event_cluster != 0) %>%  # Exclude noise clusters
  group_by(year, month) %>%
  summarise(n_events = n()) %>%

# Print the summary table
print(fire_events_per_month)

# Reshape the data to a wide format
fire_events_wide <- fire_events_per_month %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = month, values_from = n_events, values_fill = 0)

# Print the wide format summary table
print(fire_events_wide)

```

#### *The table summary shows how the clustered fire events are counted in yearly basis per monthly views.*

#### Final view of subset heatmap from May - October for further analysis.

### Explore and Interpretation of data variables to determine further data concentration.

#### Coordinate (Latitude and Longitude)

```{r}
range(hotspots$lat, na.rm = TRUE) #range is valid
range(hotspots$lon, na.rm = TRUE) #range is valid

# British Columbia coordinate :
# Latitude: Between 48.309789째N and 60.00065째N
# Longitude: Between -139.058200 째W and -114.05423째W
```

#### Rep_date (Date range)

```{r}
# Extract year and number of points from event_details
events_count <- event_details %>%
  select(year, events_count)

# Check the extracted table
print(events_count)
```

#### *The period of data covers 10 years period started from 2014 and included the major fire events in 2023.*

#### *The boxplot of DC values across years show the variability and trends in drought conditions over time.*

#### *2017 and 2018: These years have higher median and upper whisker values, meaning very dry conditions, likely leading to severe fire seasons.*

# 4-7: Moderate spread potential. Fires spread more quickly and may require more effort to control.
# 8-12: High spread potential. Fires spread rapidly and can be difficult to control.
# 13-19: Very high spread potential. Fires spread very rapidly and are challenging to control.

```

#### *BUI, DMC, and DC are all indicators of fire potential. High values in these indices suggest drier conditions, which can lead to higher fire.*

```

#### *Different years show a lot of differences in HFI values. For example, 2014 and 2021 had higher peaks, meaning there was more intense fire activity in those years.*

#### *2020 had lower HFI values, there were milder fire conditions or better fire control efforts.The plots also show how HFI can change from month to month within a single fire season.Weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed, can affect how fires behave.*

#### Analyze the trends of HFI and the number of fire events.
